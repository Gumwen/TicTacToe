Tic-Tac-Toe Game Pseudocode:
1. Initialize a 3x3 board with empty cells.
2. Alternate turns between the human player and the computer.
3. For each turn:
   - Human selects a cell (ensure the cell is not occupied).
   - Computer selects a cell (use basic AI logic to block or win).
4. Check for winning conditions after each move:
   - 3 in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - If the board is full with no winner, itâ€™s a draw.
5. Display results and exit.
